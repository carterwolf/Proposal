# Title
Final Project Proposal

## Repository
https://github.com/carterwolf/Proposal.git

## Description
I want the program to output a video that starts with some text that will start glitching. While glitching, I want the words and the colors to change and ultimately fade out and have a picture fade in. (I also may want to add background music)

## Features
- Feature 1 - Color Change
	- Using the Pygame color library, I will use the RGB channels to make the words change colors
- Feature 2 - Glitch Effect
	- I will try and figure out how to make the words glitch into different ones
- Feature N - Fade Out
	- Like one of the more recent lessons, I will use Python Image software to make the words fade out and the picture fade in

## Challenges
- In order to execute this project, I would need to do research on how to implement background music. 
- I will also have to learn how to make the glitching text effect
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I would like for the text and text color ot change through glitching and want it to fade out and a picture fade in with music behind it

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- For this project, I will be fine with the minimal output being The text glitching into different words adn have it fade out with music

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Figure out how to apply background music and apply glitch effect
  2. Find a picture to put into the code

- Week 2
  1. Have the text glitch into different text and color
  2. Complete fade out

- Week N (Final)
  1. Complete fade in
  2. Fix any bugs with the code and touch it up a bit
